# Java DSA

## Basics

#### Java Objects are by default null-initialized. C++ has garbage-values.
 - Eg: strings are initialized with "", objects with null, int with 0, float with 0.0, boolean with false.

## 1-D Arrays
 - Empty array declaration: type[ ] name = new type[size]
 - Custom array declaration: type[ ] name = {a,b,c,d}
